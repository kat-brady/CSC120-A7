- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

In House, I overloaded moveIn and moveOut. For moveIn, I made it so multiple residents of unknown name could be moved in at once. This is because I don't know the names of all my housemates, but know the approximate number. For moveOut, I made it also be able to be a void that takes no arguments and moves out all the residents at once, which is useful for the summer move out time. In Cafe, I overloaded sellCoffee to allow to sell black coffee specifically without any extra add-ons, as this is popular with older people especially. I also overloaded the cafe contructor itself, so that one can make a cafe using only the name and address, which will set the number of floors and inventory to default values, in case someone does not wish to specify many integers.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think tinkering worked here. I didn't really run into a lot of issues this time. I would say to someone going into this course that it does get easier, and that's really cool.
